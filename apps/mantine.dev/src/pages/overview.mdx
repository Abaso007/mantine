# Features overview

This article will help you understand what features Mantine props and
what benefits you get from using a components library.

## What is Mantine and what it is not

Mantine is a React components and hooks library. It provides components
with logic and minimal styles that share common design principles and
API. Mantine is not a design system, you can think of it as a set of
functions that can be used to build your applications.

Mantine is a library, not a framework â€“ it does not dictate how you
should build your application. You can use Mantine hooks and components
with any third-party tools and libraries.

## Accessibility

All Mantine components are accessible out of the box, this includes: keyboard navigation support,
focus management, screen reader support, and more. Mantine components are tested automatically with
[Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) and manually with [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) accessibility tools.

Example of accessible [Select](/core/select/) component, try to navigate through options with keyboard
only:

<Demo data={SelectDemos.searchable} />
