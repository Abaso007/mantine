# Getting started

## Get started with a template

The easiest way to get started is to use one of the templates.
All templates include required dependencies and pre-configured settings.
Some templates also include additional features like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/),
[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), etc.

Templates include only `@mantine/core` and `@mantine/hooks` packages,
if you need additional `@mantine/*` packages, follow installation instructions
of the package you want to use.

To get started with a template, open it on GitHub and click "Use this template"
button. In order to use this feature you need to be logged in to your GitHub account.
If you are not familiar with GitHub, you can find a detailed instruction on how to
bootstrap a project from a template [in this article](https://help.mantine.dev/q/templates-usage).

## Community templates

Community templates are created and maintained by the community members. These templates
include additional features and third-party integrations. You are welcome
to share your template with the community by following [this guide](https://help.mantine.dev/q/submit-template).

## Framework guide

If you want to add Mantine to an existing project or prefer to set up everything manually,
follow one of the guides below to get started with Mantine and your preferred framework.

<FrameworksGuides />

## Can I use Mantine with create-react-app?

[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) was deprecated in early 2023 ([comment from maintainers](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/pull/5487#issuecomment-1409720741)).
It is not recommended to use it for new projects. It is recommended to use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) instead.
Starting from version 7.0, certain Mantine styling features are no longer officially supported in Create React App.
If you still prefer to use Create React App, follow [this guide](https://help.mantine.dev/q/can-i-use-mantine-with-cra).

## Get started without framework

<PackagesInstallation />

Install PostCSS plugins and [postcss-preset-mantine](/styles/postcss-preset):

<InstallScript
  packages="postcss postcss-preset-mantine postcss-simple-vars"
  dev
/>

> **PostCSS without framework**
>
> If you are using a framework that is not officially supported,
> you may need to configure PostCSS manually. Please refer to the framework's documentation for specific instructions.
> For instance, if you are using Webpack, it will be necessary to install and set up [postcss-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/postcss-loader/).

Create `postcss.config.cjs` file at the root of your application with the following content:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    'postcss-preset-mantine': {},
    'postcss-simple-vars': {
      variables: {
        'mantine-breakpoint-xs': '36em',
        'mantine-breakpoint-sm': '48em',
        'mantine-breakpoint-md': '62em',
        'mantine-breakpoint-lg': '75em',
        'mantine-breakpoint-xl': '88em',
      },
    },
  },
};
```

Add styles imports to the root of your application. Usually styles are imported
once in the root file. For example, if you are using Next.js with pages router,
you can import styles in `_app.tsx` file:

```tsx
// core styles are required for all packages
import '@mantine/core/styles.css';

// other css files are required only if
// you are using components from the corresponding package
// import '@mantine/dates/styles.css';
// import '@mantine/dropzone/styles.css';
// import '@mantine/code-highlight/styles.css';
// ...
```

Wrap your application with [MantineProvider](/theming/mantine-provider/):

```tsx
import { createTheme, MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';

const theme = createTheme({
  /** Put your mantine theme override here */
});

function Demo() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider theme={theme}>
      {/* Your app here */}
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}
```

If your application has server side rendering, add [ColorSchemeScript](/theming/color-schemes)
to the `<head />` of your application:

```tsx
import { ColorSchemeScript } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo() {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charSet="UTF-8" />
        <meta
          name="viewport"
          content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
        />
        <title>My awesome app</title>

        <ColorSchemeScript />
      </head>
      <body>{/* Your app here */}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

All set! You can now use Mantine components in your application.

## Set up VS Code

By default, VS Code does not recognize postcss syntax, you need to install
[PostCSS Intellisense and Highlighting](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vunguyentuan.vscode-postcss)
to enable syntax highlighting and suppress variables (`$variable`) errors.

To get CSS variables autocomplete, install [CSS Variable Autocomplete extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vunguyentuan.vscode-css-variables).
Then create `.vscode/settings.json` file in the root folder of your project with the following content:

```json
{
  "cssVariables.lookupFiles": [
    "**/*.css",
    "**/*.scss",
    "**/*.sass",
    "**/*.less",
    "node_modules/@mantine/core/styles.css"
  ]
}
```

## Learn

Before you jump into the code, it is recommended to learn more about Mantine theming and styling options.
The most important documentation pages are:

- [Theme object](/theming/theme-object) – learn about available theme properties
- [Colors](/theming/colors) – learn how to add/replace colors in the theme object
- [CSS modules](/styles/css-modules) – learn how to use CSS modules with Mantine
- [postcss-preset-mantine](/styles/postcss-preset) – learn about `postcss-preset-mantine` functions and mixins
- [Responsive styles](/styles/responsive) – learn how to apply responsive styles to components
- [Styles API](/styles/styles-api) – learn how to style internal elements of any component
- [Polymorphic components](/guides/polymorphic) – learn how to use polymorphic components to change rendered element

## Mantine for Figma

Design is not a part of the development process – there are no official
Figma or Sketch design files. However, there are community-driven projects that provide Figma components
based on Mantine. Note that these projects are not maintained by Mantine team, and it is not guaranteed
that they are up-to-date with the latest Mantine version.
