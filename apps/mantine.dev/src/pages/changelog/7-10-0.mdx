## Checkbox.Indicator component

New [Checkbox.Indicator](/core/checkbox/#checkboxindicator) looks exactly the same as `Checkbox` component, but it does not
have any semantic meaning, it's just a visual representation of checkbox state. You
can use it in any place where you need to display checkbox state without any interaction
related to the indicator. For example, it is useful in cards based on buttons, trees, etc.

Note that `Checkbox.Indicator` cannot be focused or selected with keyboard. It is not
accessible and should not be used as a replacement for `Checkbox` component.

<Demo data={CheckboxDemos.indicator} />

## Checkbox.Card component

[Checkbox.Card](/core/checkbox/#checkboxcard-component) component can be used as a replacement for `Checkbox` to build custom
cards/buttons/other things that work as checkboxes. The root element of the component
has `role="checkbox"` attribute, it is accessible by default and supports the same
keyboard interactions as `input[type="checkbox"]`.

<Demo data={CheckboxDemos.card} />

You can use `Checkbox.Card` with `Checkbox.Group` the same way as `Checkbox` component:

<Demo data={CheckboxDemos.cardGroup} />
