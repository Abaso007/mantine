## Usage

`TimePicker` component is an alternative to [TimeInput](/dates/time-input) that offers more
features, it supports 24-hour and 12-hour formats, dropdown with hours, minutes and seconds, and
more.

<Demo data={TimePickerDemos.usage} />

## Controlled

`TimePicker` component value is a string in `hh:mm:ss` 24-hour format (for example `18:34:55`).
Empty string is used to represent no value. `onChange` function is called only when the entered value is valid.
The input value is considered valid in the following cases:

- All inputs are empty. In this case `onChange` is called with an empty string.
- All inputs are filled. For example if `withSeconds` prop is set and the user entered `12:34:56`, `onChange` will be called with `12:34:56`. But if the user entered `12:34`, `onChange` will not be called because seconds value is missing.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { TimePicker } from '@mantine/dates';

function Demo() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');
  return <TimePicker value={value} onChange={setValue} />;
}
```

## With seconds

Set `withSeconds` prop to enable seconds input. Note that if this prop is used,
`onChange` is not called until all inputs are filled â€“ it is not possible
to enter only hours and minutes.

<Demo data={TimePickerDemos.withSeconds} />

## 12-hour format

Set `format="12h"` to use 12-hour format. Note that `onChange` is called only when all inputs are filled
including am/pm input.

<Demo data={TimePickerDemos.format12h} />

## Change am/pm labels

To change am/pm labels use `amPmLabels` prop. Example of changing labels to Hindi:

<Demo data={TimePickerDemos.amPmLabels} />

## Min and max values

Set `min` and `max` props to limit available time range:

<Demo data={TimePickerDemos.minMax} />

## With dropdown

Set `withDropdown` prop to display the dropdown with hours, minutes, seconds and am/pm selects.
By default, the dropdown is visible when one of the inputs is focused.

<Demo data={TimePickerDemos.withDropdown} />

## Hours/minutes/seconds step

Use `hoursStep`, `minutesStep` and `secondsStep` props to control step for each input.
These props are used to control value by which the input is incremented or decremented when
up/down arrow keys are pressed and to generate corresponding values range in the dropdown.

<Demo data={TimePickerDemos.steps} />

## Control dropdown opened state

Use `popoverProps` to pass props down to the underlying [Popover](/core/popover) component:

<Demo data={TimePickerDemos.controlledDropdown} />

## Paste events

By default, `TimePicker` handles only time in 24-hour format (for example `17:33:43` or `19:22`) for paste events.
With `pasteSplit` prop you can create a custom paste time parser:

<Demo data={TimePickerDemos.pasteSplit} />

## Clearable

Set `clearable` prop to display a clear button in the right section of the input.
The clear button is visible when at least one of the fields has value.

<Demo data={TimePickerDemos.clearable} />

## Disabled

<Demo data={TimePickerDemos.disabled} />

## Read only

<Demo data={TimePickerDemos.readOnly} />

## Input props

<InputFeatures component="TimePicker" element="div" />

<Demo data={TimePickerDemos.configurator} />
